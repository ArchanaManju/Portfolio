# My Portfolio (Parcel + React)

This project has been wired to use Parcel as the bundler and React as the UI library.

How to run locally:

```bash
cd /Users/archanamaruthi/Documents/MyPortfolio
npm install
npm run dev    # starts Parcel dev server
# open http://localhost:1234 in your browser
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Notes:
- Your existing `src/App.jsx` is used as the root React component.
- `src/index.css` is a small fallback; if you want Tailwind or other tooling, I can add that next.
